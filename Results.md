## Results and Case Study

- Water level threshold set to 5m
- Email was sent successfully as soon as the water level crossed the limit
- Flow sensor also triggered alerts as expected
- System responded reliably in both test and simulated scenarios

## Discussion

The IoT system is suitable for real-time deployment in dams, canals, and flood-prone zones. Alerts ensure authorities can take action before critical failure or overflow.

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile app notifications
- Integration with ML for predictions
- LoRa/NB-IoT for rural deployment
