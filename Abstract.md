## Abstract

This IoT-based system monitors water levels using an ultrasonic sensor and a microcontroller (ESP32). If the water level exceeds a predefined limit, it triggers an email alert using SMTP protocol. Designed for flood-prone areas, this system provides a scalable and efficient solution for water management across urban and rural settings.
